# .dotfiles
Repository to keep the dotfiles and learn how to handle them.

Currently only tested with macOS.

---

The dotbot is taking care to put the dotfiles in place. To configure the paths use the install.conf.yaml:
"- link:" -> takes care of the symlinks. Paths should be as follows:
"{where_the_symlink_should_be_placed}: {symlink_source}"
